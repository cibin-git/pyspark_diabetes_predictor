Great 👍 Let’s understand Dimensionality Reduction — crucial when you have many features.

Used for:
	•	Visualization
	•	Noise reduction
	•	Speeding up ML models
	•	Removing multicollinearity

We’ll cover:
	•	📉 PCA (Linear)
	•	🌈 t-SNE (Nonlinear, visualization)
	•	🚀 UMAP (Modern nonlinear method)

⸻

📉 1️⃣ PCA — Principal Component Analysis

📌 What It Does

PCA finds new axes (principal components) that:
	•	Capture maximum variance
	•	Are orthogonal to each other
	•	Reduce dimensionality

It’s a linear transformation.

⸻

🧠 Intuition

Imagine 2D data shaped like a tilted ellipse.

Instead of using X and Y axes,
PCA rotates axes to align with the direction of maximum variance.

⸻

🧮 Mathematical Idea
	1.	Center the data
	2.	Compute covariance matrix
	3.	Compute eigenvectors & eigenvalues
	4.	Sort by largest eigenvalues
	5.	Project data onto top components

⸻

🐍 Example

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import numpy as np

X = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # 5D data

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)

print("Explained variance ratio:")
print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)


⸻

📊 When PCA Is Good

✔ Linear structure
✔ Removing correlated features
✔ Preprocessing for regression
✔ Finance (factor models)

⸻

⚠️ Limitations

❌ Cannot capture nonlinear structure
❌ Hard to interpret components

⸻

🌈 2️⃣ t-SNE — t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding

Developed for visualization of high-dimensional data.

Commonly used in:
	•	NLP embeddings
	•	Image embeddings
	•	Clustering visualization

⸻

📌 Core Idea

Preserve local neighbor relationships.

If two points are close in high-dimension,
they should stay close in low-dimension.

⸻

🧠 How It Works (High Level)
	1.	Convert distances → probabilities
	2.	Match distributions in low dimension
	3.	Minimize KL divergence

It uses heavy-tailed distribution (Student-t) to avoid crowding problem.

⸻

🐍 Example

from sklearn.manifold import TSNE

tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=0)
X_embedded = tsne.fit_transform(X)


⸻

📊 When t-SNE Is Good

✔ Visualization (2D or 3D)
✔ Discover clusters visually
✔ Embedding analysis

⸻

⚠️ Limitations

❌ Not good for large datasets
❌ Not stable (different runs differ)
❌ Not good for downstream ML

⸻

🚀 3️⃣ UMAP — Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection

Modern alternative to t-SNE.

Faster and preserves more global structure.

⸻

📌 Core Idea

Assumes data lies on a manifold.

Steps:
	1.	Construct fuzzy topological graph
	2.	Optimize low-dimensional embedding
	3.	Preserve local and some global structure

⸻

🐍 Example

import umap

reducer = umap.UMAP(n_components=2)
X_umap = reducer.fit_transform(X)


⸻

📊 Why UMAP Is Popular

✔ Faster than t-SNE
✔ Better global structure preservation
✔ Works well for large datasets
✔ Often used for embedding visualization

⸻

📊 PCA vs t-SNE vs UMAP

Method	Linear?	Fast?	Best For	Stable?
PCA	Yes	Very fast	Preprocessing	Yes
t-SNE	No	Slow	Visualization	No
UMAP	No	Fast	Visualization + structure	More stable


⸻

🧠 Geometric Insight

PCA

Rotates axes to maximize variance.

t-SNE

Preserves local neighborhood probabilities.

UMAP

Builds manifold graph and compresses it.

⸻

🎯 Real-World Examples

PCA
	•	Risk factor modeling
	•	Removing multicollinearity
	•	Feature compression before regression

t-SNE
	•	Visualizing BERT embeddings
	•	Checking cluster separation

UMAP
	•	Visualizing millions of embeddings
	•	Customer segmentation visualization

For models like BERT or ChatGPT embeddings, UMAP is commonly used for visualization.

⸻

🧠 When To Use What?

Use PCA when:
	•	You need faster ML
	•	You want dimensionality reduction for modeling

Use t-SNE when:
	•	You want 2D plot for presentation

Use UMAP when:
	•	You want better structure preservation
	•	Large embedding visualization

	•	UMAP vs t-SNE detailed comparison
	•	Dimensionality reduction for finance risk modeling
	•	Applying PCA before tree models (good or bad?)
