Great 👍 Now let’s understand Clustering — an unsupervised learning technique.

Unlike classification:
	•	No labels
	•	No ground truth
	•	We discover structure in data

We’ll focus on:
	•	🔵 K-Means
	•	🌌 DBSCAN

⸻

🔵 1️⃣ K-Means Clustering

📌 What It Does

Groups data into K clusters based on similarity.

Goal:

Minimize within-cluster variance.

⸻

🧠 How It Works (Step-by-Step)
	1.	Choose K (number of clusters)
	2.	Randomly initialize K centroids
	3.	Assign each point to nearest centroid
	4.	Recompute centroids
	5.	Repeat until convergence

⸻

🧮 Objective Function

Minimize:

\sum_{i=1}^{K} \sum_{x \in C_i} ||x - \mu_i||^2

Where:
	•	\mu_i = centroid
	•	C_i = cluster

⸻

🐍 Python Example

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1,2],[1,4],[1,0],
              [10,2],[10,4],[10,0]])

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0)
kmeans.fit(X)

print("Cluster centers:")
print(kmeans.cluster_centers_)

print("Labels:")
print(kmeans.labels_)


⸻

📊 When K-Means Works Well

✔ Clusters are spherical
✔ Similar cluster sizes
✔ Low noise

⸻

⚠️ Limitations

❌ Must choose K
❌ Sensitive to outliers
❌ Struggles with non-spherical clusters

⸻

🌌 2️⃣ DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)

Very different approach.

DBSCAN stands for:

Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise

⸻

📌 Core Idea

Clusters are areas of high density separated by low density.

Instead of choosing K, we define:
	•	eps (distance radius)
	•	min_samples (minimum points to form cluster)

⸻

🧠 How It Works

A point is:
	•	Core point → enough neighbors within eps
	•	Border point → near core
	•	Noise → isolated point

DBSCAN grows clusters from core points.

⸻

🐍 Python Example

from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN

dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=2, min_samples=2)
dbscan.fit(X)

print("Labels:")
print(dbscan.labels_)

Note:
	•	Label = -1 → noise

⸻

📊 When DBSCAN Is Powerful

✔ Arbitrary shaped clusters
✔ Handles noise automatically
✔ No need to choose K

Example:
	•	Geographic data
	•	Anomaly detection
	•	Spatial clustering

⸻

🔥 K-Means vs DBSCAN

Feature	K-Means	DBSCAN
Need K	Yes	No
Handles noise	No	Yes
Shape of clusters	Spherical	Arbitrary
Sensitive to scale	Yes	Yes
Works well with outliers	No	Yes

🧠 Geometric Intuition

K-Means

Draws circular boundaries around centroids.

DBSCAN

Draws blobs around dense regions.

⸻

📈 Real-World Use Cases

K-Means
	•	Customer segmentation
	•	Credit card usage patterns
	•	Market segmentation

DBSCAN
	•	Fraud detection
	•	Geospatial clustering
	•	Detecting abnormal transactions

⸻

🎯 For Your Use Cases

Since you’re interested in:
	•	Property valuation
	•	Credit modeling
	•	Geo-data

DBSCAN is powerful for:
	•	Clustering land parcels by density
	•	Identifying abnormal pricing zones

K-Means is good for:
	•	Customer segmentation
	•	Risk band grouping

⸻
