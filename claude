What makes Claude different?

Anthropic designed Claude around AI safety and alignment using a method called “Constitutional AI.”

Instead of only training from human feedback, Claude is trained using a structured set of principles (a “constitution”) to:
	•	Reduce harmful outputs
	•	Avoid unsafe instructions
	•	Be more transparent and reliable
	•	Provide balanced answers

In simple terms

Claude is designed to be:
	•	Helpful
	•	Harmless
	•	Honest

If you’re exploring building your own LM agent locally (like you asked earlier), I can also explain how Claude differs architecturally from models like OpenAI’s GPT models or open-source LLMs.
