These are foundational models in ML and still heavily used in production systems.

⸻

1️⃣ Linear Regression

📌 What It Does

Predicts a continuous value.

Examples:
	•	House price prediction
	•	Sales forecasting
	•	Temperature prediction

⸻

🧮 Model Equation

y = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n

Or in vector form:

y = w^T x + b

Where:
	•	x = features
	•	w = weights
	•	b = bias
	•	y = predicted value

⸻

🎯 Objective

Minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE):

MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum (y_{true} - y_{pred})^2

⸻

🐍 Simple Python Example

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print("Weight:", model.coef_)
print("Bias:", model.intercept_)
print("Prediction for 5:", model.predict([[5]]))

This learns:
y = 2x

⸻

📊 When to Use

✔ Continuous output
✔ Relationship roughly linear
✔ Interpretability required

⸻

2️⃣ Logistic Regression

Despite the name, this is used for classification, not regression.

⸻

📌 What It Does

Predicts probability of class membership.

Examples:
	•	Spam vs Not Spam
	•	Loan Default vs No Default
	•	Fraud vs Genuine

⸻

🧮 Model Idea

First compute linear output:

z = w^T x + b

Then apply Sigmoid function:

\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}

This converts output into probability (0 to 1).

⸻

🎯 Objective

Minimize Log Loss (Cross Entropy):

Loss = -[y \log(p) + (1-y)\log(1-p)]

⸻

🐍 Simple Python Example

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[0], [1], [2], [3]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print("Prediction probability for 1.5:",
      model.predict_proba([[1.5]]))


⸻

📊 Key Differences

Linear Regression	Logistic Regression
Predicts continuous value	Predicts probability
Uses MSE loss	Uses Log loss
Output: (-∞, +∞)	Output: (0,1)
For regression tasks	For classification


⸻

🔍 Geometric Interpretation

Both models:
	•	Create a linear decision boundary
	•	In 2D → straight line
	•	In 3D → plane

Logistic regression separates classes using a hyperplane.

⸻

🧠 Why Linear Models Still Matter

Even in deep learning era:

✔ Fast training
✔ Highly interpretable
✔ Works well on tabular data
✔ Strong baseline model

For example:
	•	Credit scoring systems
	•	Risk modeling
	•	Healthcare prediction systems

Many banking systems still rely on logistic regression because it’s explainable.
