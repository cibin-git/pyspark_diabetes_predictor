Great 👍 Now we’re entering Neural Networks — the foundation of modern AI.

We’ll cover:
	•	🧠 MLPs (Multilayer Perceptrons)
	•	👁 CNNs (Computer Vision)
	•	🔁 RNNs & 🔥 Transformers (Sequences & NLP)

⸻

🧠 1️⃣ MLP — Multilayer Perceptron

📌 What It Is

An MLP is a fully connected neural network.

Structure:

Input → Hidden Layer → Hidden Layer → Output

Each layer:

z = W x + b
a = \text{activation}(z)

Common activations:
	•	ReLU
	•	Sigmoid
	•	Tanh

⸻

🧠 What It Learns

MLPs learn nonlinear relationships.

They are universal approximators:

Given enough neurons, they can approximate any function.

⸻

🐍 Simple Example (PyTorch-style)

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(4, 16),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(16, 1)
)


⸻

📊 Use Cases
	•	Tabular data
	•	Basic classification
	•	Regression tasks

But for images or sequences → not ideal.

⸻

👁 2️⃣ CNN — Convolutional Neural Networks

Best for:
	•	Images
	•	Video
	•	Spatial data

⸻

📌 Why Not MLP for Images?

Example: 224×224 image
= 50,000+ pixels

MLP would require massive parameters.

CNN solves this using:

🔹 Convolution Filters

Small kernels (3×3, 5×5) slide across image.

This:
	•	Detects edges
	•	Detects textures
	•	Detects shapes

⸻

🧠 Key Components
	•	Convolution layer
	•	ReLU
	•	Pooling
	•	Fully connected layer

⸻

🔥 Famous CNN Models
	•	LeNet
	•	ResNet
	•	VGGNet

⸻

📊 Why CNNs Work

✔ Parameter sharing
✔ Translation invariance
✔ Efficient
✔ Hierarchical feature learning

Used in:
	•	Face recognition
	•	Medical imaging
	•	Object detection
	•	Autonomous vehicles

⸻

🔁 3️⃣ RNN — Recurrent Neural Networks

Best for:
	•	Sequences
	•	Time series
	•	Text

⸻

📌 Core Idea

Instead of independent inputs:

RNN keeps memory:

h_t = f(x_t, h_{t-1})

It remembers previous context.

⸻

⚠️ Problem

Vanishing gradients.

Solution:
	•	LSTM
	•	GRU

⸻

🔥 Used in:
	•	Speech recognition
	•	Language modeling (before transformers)
	•	Stock prediction

⸻

🚀 4️⃣ Transformers (Modern NLP Revolution)

Transformers replaced RNNs.

Core idea:

✨ Self-Attention

Instead of sequential memory, every token attends to every other token.

This allows:

✔ Parallel processing
✔ Long-range dependencies
✔ Massive scaling

⸻

🔥 Famous Transformer Models
	•	BERT
	•	GPT-3
	•	ChatGPT

All based on the original Transformer paper:
“Attention Is All You Need”

⸻

🧠 Why Transformers Win

Model	Limitation
RNN	Sequential, slow
LSTM	Still sequential
Transformer	Fully parallel

Transformers scale better with GPUs.

⸻

📊 Quick Comparison

Model	Best For	Structure
MLP	Tabular	Fully connected
CNN	Vision	Convolution filters
RNN	Short sequences	Recurrent memory
Transformer	NLP, long sequences	Self-attention


⸻

🎯 Real-World Mapping (Based on Your Interests)

Since you work with:
	•	ML pipelines → MLP for tabular
	•	Property/finance modeling → MLP or tree models
	•	Content generation → Transformers
	•	Sequential credit risk → RNN/Transformer

⸻

🧠 Deep Insight

All neural networks are:

y = f(Wx + b)

The difference is how connections are structured:
	•	MLP → dense
	•	CNN → local + shared weights
	•	RNN → recurrent
	•	Transformer → attention-based

⸻

If you want next, I can explain:
	•	Backpropagation mathematically
	•	Attention mechanism step-by-step
	•	CNN intuition visually
	•	Why transformers replaced RNNs
	•	How LLMs are trained at scale
	•	Neural networks vs tree models for tabular data
