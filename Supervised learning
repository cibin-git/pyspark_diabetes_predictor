Supervised learning — expanded explanation, key points, and two minimal examples.

What it is
- Train a model on labeled examples (input x paired with target y). The model learns a mapping f(x) → y.
- Two main task types:
  - Classification: predict discrete labels (e.g., disease vs healthy).
  - Regression: predict continuous values (e.g., blood glucose level).

Core workflow
- Prepare labeled dataset → feature engineering → split into train/validation/test → choose model → train (minimize loss) → evaluate on validation/test → tune hyperparameters → deploy → monitor for drift.
- Loss examples: cross-entropy for classification, MSE for regression.
- Common pitfalls: overfitting, data leakage, class imbalance.
- Regularization / mitigation: L1/L2, dropout, early stopping, cross-validation, resampling or class weights for imbalance.

Common models & when to use
- Linear/Logistic Regression: simple, interpretable baselines.
- Decision Trees / Random Forests / Gradient Boosting: strong tabular performance.
- SVMs: smaller datasets, clear margins.
- Neural Networks: large/complex data (images, text); Transformers for sequence/NLP.
- Ensembles for improved accuracy; simpler models are good baselines.

Evaluation metrics
- Classification: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix.
- Regression: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R².
- Choose metrics aligned with the business objective (e.g., prioritize recall for disease screening).

Minimal scikit-learn classification example
```
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

preds = clf.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, preds))
print(classification_report(y_test, preds))
```

Minimal PySpark MLlib (logistic regression) example
```
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler, StringIndexer
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("supervised-example").getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)  # assume labelled 'label' column

feature_cols = [c for c in df.columns if c != "label"]
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")
data = assembler.transform(df).select("features", "label")

train, test = data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=42)
lr = LogisticRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="label", maxIter=20)
model = lr.fit(train)

pred = model.transform(test)
evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="label")
print("ROC AUC:", evaluator.evaluate(pred))
```

If you want, I can:
- Add a short supervised-learning section into your Machine learning basics file (commit with a message you provide), or
- Expand into a full tutorial (including hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, class imbalance strategies), or
- Provide a regression example or notebook for your pyspark_diabetes_predictor project. Which would you like?
